#Project Overview

- for exercise A, we cloned the GitHub repository through VSCode, as well as the push and pull function.

- for exercise C, we used the flex technique in order to ensure the layout is responsive. This was designed for desktop, tablet and mobile layouts and changed the display according to each different screen size.

- for exercise D, we formatted the README file to explain the overview of the project, as well as the group members and screenshots of the completed results.
